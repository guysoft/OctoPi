### Configure the max number of cameras Mjpg-streamer will handle
#
# Number of streams Mjpg-streamer will handle. Please be aware that the Rpi
# may not be able to handle a lot of concurrent streams. Should the setting
# appear more than once in all the configuration files, only the maximum 
# value will be kept.
#
# Defaults to 2
#
#nb_max_camera=2

### Configure which camera to use
#
# Available options are:
# - auto: tries first usb webcam, if that's not available tries raspi cam
# - usb: only tries usb webcam
# - raspi: only tries raspi cam
#
# Defaults to auto
#
#camera="auto"

### Additional options to supply to MJPG Streamer for the USB camera
#
# See https://faq.octoprint.org/mjpg-streamer-config for available options
#
# Defaults to a resolution of 640x480 px and a framerate of 10 fps
#
#camera_usb_options="-r 640x480 -f 10"

### Additional webcam devices known to cause problems with -f
#
# Apparently there a some devices out there that with the current 
# mjpg_streamer release do not support the -f parameter (for specifying 
# the capturing framerate) and will just refuse to output an image if it 
# is supplied.
#
# The webcam daemon will detect those devices by their USB Vendor and Product
# ID and remove the -f parameter from the options provided to mjpg_streamer.
#
# By default, this is done for the following devices:
#   Logitech C170 (046d:082b)
#   GEMBIRD (1908:2310)
#   Genius F100 (0458:708c)
#   Cubeternet GL-UPC822 UVC WebCam (1e4e:0102)
#
# Using the following option it is possible to add additional devices. If
# your webcam happens to show above symptoms, try determining your cam's
# vendor and product id via lsusb, activating the line below by removing # and 
# adding it, e.g. for two broken cameras "aabb:ccdd" and "aabb:eeff"
#
#   additional_brokenfps_usb_devices=("aabb:ccdd" "aabb:eeff")
#
# If this fixes your problem, please report it back so we can include the device
# out of the box: https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues
#
#additional_brokenfps_usb_devices=()

### Additional options to supply to MJPG Streamer for the RasPi Cam
#
# See https://faq.octoprint.org/mjpg-streamer-config for available options.
#
# NOTE: Newer raspi cam modules are reporting as usb devices causing these
#       options to be ignored. Set `camera="raspi"` to avoid these issues.
#
# Defaults to 10fps
#
#camera_raspi_options="-fps 10"

### Configuration of camera HTTP output
#
# Usually you should NOT need to change this at all! Only touch if you
# know what you are doing and what the parameters mean.
#
# Below settings are used in the mjpg-streamer call like this:
#
#   -o "output_http.so -w $camera_http_webroot $camera_http_options"
#
# Current working directory is the mjpg-streamer base directory.
#
#camera_http_webroot="./www-octopi"
#camera_http_options="-n"

# Configuration of network monitoring
#
# This enables network monitoring for wifi connections with a simple ping test.
# If connection terminates by variable reasons system tries to restart the wifi connection to reestablish a connection.
# The connection test is done every minute.
# By default it is disabled (0 = off / 1 = on)
# destination_host can be an ip address or a hostname (for hostname ensure dns resosultion is working correctly)
enable_network_monitor=0
destination_host=192.168.1.1

### EXPERIMENTAL
# Support for different streamer types.
#
# Available options:
#   mjpeg [default] - stable MJPG-streamer
#   hls - experimental FFMPEG HLS streamer
#camera_streamer=mjpeg
