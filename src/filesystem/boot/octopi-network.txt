### WIFI CONFIGURATION ######################################################
# The three segments below should cover you in most cases if you run
# a wifi network that uses either WPA/WPA2 or WEP encryption.
#
# Just uncomment the lines prefixed with a single # of the configuration
# that matches your wifi setup and fill in SSID and passphrase.

## WPA/WPA2 secured
#iface wlan0-octopi inet manual
#    wpa-ssid "put SSID here"
#    wpa-psk "put password here"

## WEP secured
#iface wlan0-octopi inet manual
#    wireless-essid "put SSID here"
#    wireless-key "put password here"

## Open/unsecured
#iface wlan0-octopi inet manual
#    wireless-essid "put SSID here"
#    wireless-mode managed

### WIRED CONFIGURATION #####################################################
# The following segment allows you to configure your wired connection
# with a static IP.
#
# Just uncomment the lines prefixed with a single #. Then connect 
# a cable to the Pi and another system, e.g. a Laptop, and set that
# other system's network configuration to:
#
#   address:   192.168.250.10
#   netmask:   255.255.255.0
#   broadcast: 192.168.250.255
#
# You can then reach the Pi from the system's browser by going to
#
#   http://192.168.250.1
#
# or
#
#   http://octopi.local

#auto eth0:1
#iface eth0:1 inet static
#  address 192.168.250.1
#  netmask 255.255.255.0
#  broadcast 192.168.250.255
