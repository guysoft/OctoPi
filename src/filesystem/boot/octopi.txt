### Configure which camera to use
#
# Available options are:
# - auto: tries first usb webcam, if that's not available tries raspi cam
# - usb: only tries usb webcam
# - raspi: only tries raspi cam
#
# Defaults to auto
#
#camera="auto"

### Additional options to supply to MJPG Streamer for the USB camera
#
# See https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/MJPG-Streamer-configuration
# for available options
#
# Defaults to a resolution of 640x480 px and a framerate of 10 fps
#
#camera_usb_options="-r 640x480 -f 10"

### Additional webcam devices known to cause problems with -f
#
# Apparently there a some devices out there that with the current 
# mjpg_streamer release do not support the -f parameter (for specifying 
# the capturing framerate) and will just refuse to output an image if it 
# is supplied.
#
# The webcam daemon will detect those devices by their USB Vendor and Product
# ID and remove the -f parameter from the options provided to mjpg_streamer.
#
# By default, this is done for the following devices:
#   Logitech C170 (046d:082b)
#
# Using the following option it is possible to add additional devices. If
# your webcam happens to show above symptoms, try determining your cam's
# vendor and product id via lsusb, activating the line below by removing # and 
# adding it as shown examplatory.
#
# If this fixes your problem, please report it back so we can include the device
# out of the box.
