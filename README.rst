A `Raspberry Pi <http://www.raspberrypi.org/>`_ distribution for 3d printers. It includes the `OctoPrint <http://octoprint.org>`_ host software for 3d printers out of the box and `mjpg-streamer with RaspiCam support <https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer>`_ for live viewing of prints and timelapse video creation. OctoPi also includes `OctoPiPanel <https://github.com/jonaslorander/OctoPiPanel>`_, which is an LCD display app that works with OctoPrint, and scripts to configure supported display.s
This repository contains the source script to generate the distribution out of an existing `Raspbian <http://www.raspbian.org/>`_ distro image.

Where to get it?

   :target: https://octopi.octoprint.org/latest

Official mirror is `here <http://docstech.net/OctoPiMirror/>`_

Nightly builds are available `here <http://gnet.homelinux.com/OctoPi/nightly/>`_

How to use it?
--------------

#. Unzip the image and install it to an sd card `like any other Raspberry Pi image <https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md>`_
#. Configure your WiFi by editing ``octopi-network.txt`` on the root of the flashed card when using it like a thumb drive
#. Boot the Pi from the card
#. Log into your Pi via SSH (it is located at ``octopi.local`` `if your computer supports bonjour <https://learn.adafruit.com/bonjour-zeroconf-networking-for-windows-and-linux/overview>`_ or the IP address assigned by your router), default username is "pi", default password is "raspberry", change the password using the ``passwd`` command and expand the filesystem of the SD card through the corresponding option when running ``sudo raspi-config``.

OctoPrint is located at `http://octopi.local <http://octopi.local>`_ and also at `https://octopi.local <https://octopi.local>`_. Since the SSL certificate is self signed (and generated upon first boot), you will get a certificate warning at the latter location, please ignore it.

If a USB webcam or the Raspberry Pi camera is detected, MJPG-streamer will be started automatically as webcam server. OctoPrint on OctoPi ships with correctly configured stream and snapshot URLs pointing at it. If necessary, you can reach it under `http://octopi.local/webcam/?action=stream <octopi.local/webcam/?action=stream>`_ and SSL respectively, or directly on its configured port 8080: `http://octopi.local:8080/?action=stream <octopi.local:8080/?action=stream>`_.

CuraEngine is installed and OctoPrint ships pre-configured with the correct path to utilize it for on-board-slicing. Just import a Cura Slicing Profile in OctoPrint's settings and start slicing directly on your Pi.

Features
--------

* `mjpg-streamer with RaspiCam support <https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer>`_ for live viewing of prints and timelapse video creation.
* `CuraEngine <https://github.com/Ultimaker/CuraEngine>`_ pre-installed for slicing directly on the Raspberry Pi
* `OctoPiPanel <https://github.com/jonaslorander/OctoPiPanel>`_, which is an LCD display app that works with OctoPrint
* Configuration scripts for various LCD displays

Developing
----------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. `qemu-arm-static <http://packages.debian.org/sid/qemu-user-static>`_
#. Downloaded `Raspbian <http://www.raspbian.org/>`_ image.
#. root privileges for chroot
#. Bash
#. git
#. realpath
#. sudo (the script itself calls it, running as root without sudo won't work)

Build OctoPi From within OctoPi / Raspbian / Debian / Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OctoPi can be built from Debian, Ubuntu, Raspbian, or even OctoPi.
Build requires about 2.5 GB of free space available.
You can build it by issuing the following commands::

    sudo apt-get install gawk util-linux realpath qemu-user-static git
    
    git clone https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi.git
    cd OctoPi/src/image
    curl -J -O -L  http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_latest
    cd ..
    sudo modprobe loop
    sudo bash -x ./build
    
Building OctoPi Variants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OctoPi supports building variants, which are builds with changes from the main release build. An example and other variants are available in the folder ``src/variants/example``.

To build a variant use::

    sudo bash -x ./build [Variant]
    
Building Using Vagrant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is a vagrant machine configuration to let build OctoPi in case your build environment behaves differently. Unless you do extra configuration, vagrant must run as root to have nfs folder sync working.

To use it::

    sudo apt-get install vagrant nfs-kernel-server
    sudo vagrant plugin install vagrant-nfs_guest
    sudo modprobe nfs
    cd OctoPi/src/vagrant
    sudo vagrant up

After provisioning the machine, its also possible to run a nightly build which updates from devel using::

    cd OctoPi/src/vagrant
    run_vagrant_build.sh

Usage
~~~~~

#. If needed, override existing config settings by creating a new file ``src/config.local``. You can override all settings found in ``src/config``. If you need to override the path to the Raspbian image to use for building OctoPi, override the path to be used in ``ZIP_IMG``. By default the most recent file matching ``*-raspbian.zip`` found in ``src/image`` will be used.
#. Run ``src/build`` as root.
#. The final image will be created at the ``src/workspace``

Code contribution would be appreciated!
